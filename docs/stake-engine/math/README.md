## Documentation Source

This content corresponds to pages at https://stake-engine.com/docs/math/* including extensive sub-pages for:
- High-level structure
- Game state structure
- Setup configurations
- Source files
- Calculation methods

## Note

**Content should be populated with actual documentation from the official sources.**

The math section is extensive with many nested topics. Each topic should have its own detailed documentation file as the content becomes available. Consider creating subdirectories for major subsections like:
- `math/high-level-structure/`
- `math/game-state-structure/`
- `math/source-files/`
- `math/calculations/`
